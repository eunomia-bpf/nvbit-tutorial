# mem_printf2

Demonstrates sending formatted messages from GPU code to the host using a
channel.  This example is a minimal template for building custom printf
style instrumentation.

## How it works

Memory reference instructions are instrumented to call `instrument_mem`
which pushes a preformatted string to a channel.  The host thread simply
prints each received message.

## Building

Run `make` inside this directory.

## Running

```bash
LD_PRELOAD=./tools/mem_printf2/mem_printf2.so ./app
```

The output shows the messages generated by the device instrumentation.
